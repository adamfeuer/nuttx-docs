NuttX RTOS

.. _overview:

Overview
--------

**Goals**. NuttX is a real time embedded operating system (RTOS). Its goals are:

* **Small Footprint**
  Usable in all but the tightest micro-controller environments, the focus is on the
  tiny-to-small, deeply embedded environment.

* **Rich Feature OS Set**
  The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces to support a
  rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded processors.

  NON-GOALS: It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux. In order to work with
  smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set. But standard compliance is more
  important than small footprint. Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards. Think of NuttX is a
  tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.

* **Highly Scalable**
  Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit). Scalability with rich feature set
  is accomplished with: Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable,
  use of weak symbols when available.

* **Standards Compliance**
  NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance. The primary governing standards
  are POSIX and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
  adopted for functionality not available under these standards or for functionality that is not
  appropriate for the deeply-embedded RTOS (such as ``fork()``).

  Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other standard OSs (such as
  Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

* **Real-Time**
  Fully pre-emptible; fixed priority, round-robin, and "sporadic" scheduling.

* **Totally Open**
  Non-restrictive BSD license.

* **GNU Toolchains**
  Compatible GNU toolchains based on `buildroot <http://buildroot.uclibc.org/>`__ available for `download <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
  to provide a complete development environment for many architectures.

  * **BAS 2.4**
    Seamless integration of Michael Haardt's BAS 2.4: "Bas is an interpreter for the classic dialect of the programming language BASIC. It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of the 1980s, unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a different syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs. Bas offers many ANSI BASIC statements for structured programming, such as procedures, local variables and various loop types. Further there are matrix operations, automatic LIST indentation and many statements and functions found in specific classic dialects. Line numbers are not required."

**Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?**. The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you
look at the NuttX source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising NuttX. How can NuttX be a tiny
OS with all of that?

  * **Lots of Features -- More can be smaller!**

    The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... *BUT* also that if you
    don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty for the unused features.
    And, with NuttX, you don't! If you don't use a feature, it will not be included in the final
    executable binary. You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features that
    you actually use.

    Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to the moderate-size system.
    I have executed NuttX with some simple applications in as little as 32K *total* memory (code and
    data). On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K (and
    if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

  * **Many, many files -- More really is smaller!**

   One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree. There are hundreds of source files! How can
   that be a tiny OS? Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small
   and as scalable as possible. Most files contain only a single function. Sometimes just one tiny
   function with only a few lines of code. Why?

     - **Static Libraries**.
       Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into *static libraries*
       (*archives*). Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are
       needed are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable. By having many,
       many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do not execute is ever
       included in the link. And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
       if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will not be
       included in the binary.

* **Other Tricks**

  As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static libraries
  keeps the size of NuttX down. Other tricks used in NuttX include:

  - **Configuration Files**.

    Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies what features you plan to use and
    which features you do not. This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control what is
    built into NuttX and what is not. There are hundreds of such settings (see the
    `Configuration Variable Documentation <NuttXConfigVariables.html>`__
    for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings). These many, many configuration options allow
    NuttX to be highly tuned to meet size requirements. The downside to all of these configuration options is that
    it greatly complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours. -

  - **Weak Symbols**
    The GNU toolchain supports *weak* symbols and these also help to keep the size of NuttX down.
    Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they are accessed from source code.
    Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the final binary.

Atmel SAMA5D2.

-  **Atmel SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra development board**. This is the port
   of NuttX to the Atmel SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra development board. This
   board features the Atmel SAMA5D27 microprocessor.

| 

--------------

| 

Atmel SAMA5D3. There are ports to two Atmel SAMA5D3 boards:

-  **Atmel SAMA5D3\ x-EK development boards**. This is the port of NuttX
   to the Atmel SAMA5D3\ *x*-EK development boards (where *x*\ =1,3,4,
   or 5). These boards feature the Atmel SAMA5D3\ *x* microprocessors.
   Four different SAMA5D3\ *x*-EK kits are available

   -  SAMA5D31-EK with the
      `ATSAMA5D31 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d31.aspx>`__
   -  SAMA5D33-EK with the
      `ATSAMA5D33 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d33.aspx>`__
   -  SAMA5D34-EK with the
      `ATSAMA5D34 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d34.aspx>`__
   -  SAMA5D35-EK with the
      `ATSAMA5D35 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d35.aspx>`__

   The each kit consist of an identical base board with different
   plug-in modules for each CPU. All four boards are supported by NuttX
   with a simple reconfiguration of the processor type.

   **STATUS**. Initial support for the SAMA5D3x-EK was released in
   NuttX-6.29. That initial support was minimal: There are simple test
   configurations that run out of internal SRAM and extended
   configurations that run out of the on-board NOR FLASH:

   -  A barebones NuttShell (`NSH <NuttShell.html>`__) configuration
      that can be used as the basis for further application development.
   -  A full-loaded NuttShell (`NSH <NuttShell.html>`__) configuration
      that demonstrates all of the SAMA5D3x features.

   The following support was added in Nuttx 6.30:

   -  DMA support, and
   -  PIO interrupts,

   And drivers for

   -  SPI (with DMA support),
   -  AT25 Serial Flash,
   -  Two Wire Interface (TWI), and
   -  HSMCI memory cards.

   NuttX-6.30 also introduces full USB support:

   -  High speed device controller driver,
   -  OHCI (low- and full-speed) and
   -  EHCI (high-speed) host controller driver support.

   With NuttX-6.31, these additional drivers were added:

   -  A 10/100Base-T Ethernet (EMAC) driver,
   -  A 1000Base-T Ethernet (GMAC) driver,
   -  A Real Time Clock (RTC) driver and integrated with the NuttX
      system time logic
   -  ``/dev/random`` using the SAMA5D3x True Random Number Generator
      (TRNG),
   -  A Watchdog Timer (WDT) driver,
   -  A Timer/Counter (TC) library with interface that make be used by
      other drivers that need timer support,
   -  An ADC driver that can collect multiple samples using the
      sequencer, can be trigger by a timer/counter, and supports DMA
      data transfers,
   -  A touchscreen driver based on the special features of the SAMA5D3
      ADC peripheral, An LCD controller (LCDC) frame buffer driver, and
   -  A CAN driver (Testing of the CAN has been delayed because of
      cabling issues).

   Additional board configurations were added to test and demonstrate
   these new drivers including new graphics and NxWM configurations.

   These drivers were added in NuttX-6.32:

   -  A PWM driver with DMA support
   -  An SSC-based I2S driver
   -  Support for Programmable clock outputs
   -  NAND support including support for the PMECC hardware ECC and for
      DMA transfers.

   DBGU support was added in NuttX-7.2 (primarily for the SAMA5D3
   Xplained board).

   NuttX-7.4 added support for the on-board WM8904 CODEC chip and for
   *Tickless* operation.

   Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/sama5/sama5d3x-ek/README.txt>`__
   file for further information.

**Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board** This is the port of NuttX
to the Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board. The board features the
Atmel SAMA5D36 microprocessor. See the `Atmel
Website <http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d36.aspx>`__ for additional
information about this board.

**STATUS**. This port is complete as of this writing and ready for
general use. The basic port is expected to be simple because of the
similarity to the SAMAD3\ *x*-EK boards and is available in the NuttX
7.2 release.

Most of the drivers and capabilities of the SAMA5D3x-EK boards can be
used with the SAMA5D3 Xplained board. The primary difference between the
ports is that the SAMA5D3x-EK supports NOR FLASH and NuttX can be
configured to boot directly from NOR FLASH. The SAMA5D3 Xplained board
does not have NOR FLASH and, as a consequence NuttX must boot into SDRAM
with the help of U-Boot.

Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/sama5/sama5d3-xplained/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

Atmel SAMA5D4. There is a port in progress on one Atmel SAMA5D4 board:

-  **Atmel SAMA5D4-EK/MB development boards** This is the port of NuttX
   to the Atmel SAMA5D4-MB Rev C. development board (which should be
   compatible with the SAMA5D4-EK). These boards feature the Atmel
   SAMA5D44 microprocessors with compatibility with most of the SAMA5D3
   peripherals.

   **STATUS**. At the time of the release of NuttX-7.3, the basic port
   for the SAMA5D4-MB was complete. The board had basic functionality.
   But full functionality was not available until NuttX-7.4. In
   NuttX-7.4 support was added for the L2 cache, many security features,
   XDMAC, HSMCI and Ethernet integrated with XDMAC, the LCDC, TWI, SSC,
   and most of the existing SAMA5 drivers. Timers were added to support
   *Tickless* operation. The TM7000 LCDC with the maXTouch multi-touch
   controller are also fully support in a special NxWM configuration for
   that larger display. Support for a graphics media player is included
   (although there were issues with the WM8904 audio CODEC on my board).
   An SRAM bootloader was also included. Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/sama5/sama5d4-ek/README.txt>`__
   file for current status.

Allwinner A10. These following boards are based on the Allwinner A10
have are supported by NuttX:

-  **pcDuino v1**. A port of NuttX to the pcDuino v1 board was first
   released in NuttX-6.33. See http://www.pcduino.com/ for information
   about pcDuino Lite, v1, and v2 boards. These boards are based around
   the Allwinner A10 Cortex-A8 CPU. This port was developed on the v1
   board, but the others may be compatible:

   Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/a1x/pcduino-a10/README.txt>`__
   file for further information.

   **STATUS**. This port was an experiment was was not completely
   developed. This configuration builds and runs an NuttShell (NSH), but
   only if a patch to work around some issues is applied. While not
   ready for "prime time", the pcDuino port is functional and could the
   basis for a more extensive development. There is, at present, no work
   in progress to extend this port, however.

--------------

| 

TI/Sitara AM335x. These following boards are based on the TI/Sitara
AM335x are supported by NuttX:

-  **Beaglebone Black**. A port of NuttX to the Beaglebone Black board
   was first released in NuttX-7.28. This port was contributed by Petro
   Karashchenko. This board is based on the TI/Sitara AM3358 Cortex-A8
   CPU running 1GHz.

   -  **NuttX-7.28**. This initial port in NuttX-7.28 is very sparse.
      While not ready for prodcution use, the Beaglebone Black port is
      functional and will be the basis for a more extensive development.
      Additional work in progress to extend this port and more capable
      is anticipated in NuttX-7.29.
   -  **NuttX-9.0** CAN support was added. Clock Configuration was
      added.
   -  **NuttX-7.31**. An LCD driver was added in NuttX-7.31.

NXP/Freescale i.MX6. The basic port has been completed for the following
i.MX6 board

-  **Sabre-6Quad**. This is a port to the NXP/Freescale Sabre-6Quad
   board. Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/imx6/sabre-6quad/README.txt>`__
   file for further information.

   **STATUS:** The basic, minimal port is code complete and introduced
   in NuttX-7.15, but had not yet been tested at that time due to the
   inavailability of hardware. This basic port was verified in the
   NuttX-7.16 release, however. The port is still minimal and more
   device drivers are needed to make the port usable.

   Basic support of NuttX running in SMP mode on the i.MX6Q was also
   accomplished in NuttX-7.16. However, there are still known issues
   with SMP support on this platform as described in the
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/imx6/sabre-6quad/README.txt>`__
   file for the board.

featuring the Hercules TMS570LS0432PZ chip.

| 

TI/Hercules TMS570LS31xx. Architecture support for the TMS570LS3137ZWT
part was added in NuttX 7.25 by Ivan Ucherdzhiev. Ivan also added
support for the TI Hercules TMS570LS31x USB Kit.

ARM Cortex-M0/M0+.

| 

nuvoTon NUC120. This is a port of NuttX to the nuvoTon NuTiny-SDK-NUC120
that features the NUC120LE3AN MCU.

**STATUS**. Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
This initial support is very minimal: There is a NuttShell
(`NSH <NuttShell.html>`__) configuration that might be the basis for an
application development. As of this writing, more device drivers are
needed to make this a more complete port. Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/nuc1xx/nutiny-nuc120/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**Memory Usage**. For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing
support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the
NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX. The NUC120LE2AN comes in a
48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM. When running the
NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more
than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application
development).

Static memory usage can be shown with ``size`` command:

NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH
leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application
development. Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (<4%) and leaves 14.8KB
(86%) available for heap at runtime. SRAM usage at run-time can be shown
with the NSH ``free`` command:

You can see that 10.0KB (62%) is available for further application
development.

**Development Environments:** 1) Linux with native Linux GNU toolchain,
2) Cygwin/MSYS with Cygwin GNU toolchain, 3) Cygwin/MSYS with Windows
native toolchain, or 4) Native Windows. A DIY toolchain for Linux or
Cygwin is provided by the NuttX
`buildroot <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
package.

STMicro STM32L152 (STM32L "EnergyLite" Line). Two boards are supported:

-  STM32L-Discovery. This is a port of NuttX to the STMicro
   STM32L-Discovery development board. The STM32L-Discovery board is
   based on the STM32L152RBT6 MCU (128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM).

   The STM32L-Discovery and STM32L152C DISCOVERY kits are functionally
   equivalent. The difference is the internal Flash memory size
   (STM32L152RBT6 with 128 Kbytes or STM32L152RCT6 with 256 Kbytes).
   Both boards feature:

   -  An ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface,
   -  LCD (24 segments, 4 commons),
   -  LEDs,
   -  Pushbuttons,
   -  A linear touch sensor, and
   -  Four touchkeys.

-  Nucleo-L152RE. Board support for the Nucleo-L152RE was contributed by
   Mateusz Szafoni in NuttX-7.28. Available configurations include NSH,
   ADC, and PWM.

**STATUS**. Initial support for the STM32L-Discovery was released in
NuttX-6.28. Addition (architecture-only) support for the STM32L152xC
family was added in NuttX-7.21. Support for the Nucleo-L152RE was added
in NuttX-7.28.

That initial STM32L-Discovery support included a configuration using the
NuttShell (`NSH <NuttShell.html>`__) that might be the basis for an
application development. A driver for the on-board segment LCD is
included as well as an option to drive the segment LCD from an NSH
"built-in" command. Refer to the STM32L-Discovery board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/stm32/stm32ldiscovery/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**Memory Usage**.

   REVISIT: These numbers are out of date. Current NuttX sizing might be
   somewhat larger.

For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable
and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the STM32L152RBT6
demonstrates the scalability of NuttX. The STM32L152RBT6 comes in a
64-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.

Static memory usage can be shown with ``size`` command:

NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 38.7KB of FLASH
leaving 89.3B of FLASH (70%) free from additional application
development. Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (<4%) and leaves 14.8KB
(86%) available for heap at runtime.

SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH ``free`` command:

You can see that 9.9KB (62%) of SRAM heap is still available for further
application development while NSH is running.

Kivilinna and Sami Pelkonen was included in NuttX-7.3, extending the
basic STM32L152x support. This is *architecture-only* support, meaning
that support for the boards with these chips is available, but no
support for any publicly available boards is included.

STMicro STM32F0xx (STM32 F0, ARM Cortex-M0). Support for the STM32 F0
family was contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis in NuttX-7.21. There
are ports to three different boards in this repository:

-  **STM32F0-Discovery** This board features the STM32 2F051R8 and was
   used by Alan to produce the initial STM32 F0 port. However, its very
   limited 8KB SRAM makes this port unsuitable for for usages.
   Contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis in NuttX-7.21.
-  **Nucleo-F072RB** With 16KB of SRAM the STM32 F072RB makes a much
   more usable platform.
-  **Nucleo-F091RC** With 32KB of SRAM the STM32 F091RC this board is a
   great match for NuttX. Contributed by Juha Niskanen in NuttX-7.21.

| 

**STATUS:** Status for the STM32F0xx, STM32L0xx, and STM32G0xx is shown
together since these parts share many drivers in common.

**NuttX-7.21**. In this initial release, the level of support for the
STM32 F0 family is minimal. Certainly enough is in place to support a
robust NSH configuration. There are also unverified I2C and USB device
drivers available in NuttX-7.21.

**NuttX-7.28** Added support for GPIO EXTI. From Mateusz Sfafoni.

**NuttX-7.29** Added an SPI driver. From Mateusz Sfafoni.

The Nucleus 2G board, the mbed board, the LPCXpresso, and the MCB1700
all feature the NXP LPC1768 MCU; the Olimex LPC1766-STK board features
an LPC1766. All use a GNU arm-nuttx-elf or arm-eabi toolchain\* under
either Linux or Cygwin (with native Windows GNU tools or Cygwin-based
GNU tools).

**STATUS:** The following summarizes the features that has been
developed and verified on individual LPC17xx-based boards. These
features should, however, be common and available for all LPC17xx-based
boards.

#. **Nucleus2G LPC1768**

   -  Some initial files for the LPC17xx family were released in NuttX
      5.6, but
   -  The first functional release for the NXP LPC1768/Nucleus2G
      occurred with NuttX 5.7 with Some additional enhancements through
      NuttX-5.9. Refer to the NuttX board
      `README <https://bitbucket.org/patacongo/obsoleted/src/master/configs/nucleus2g/README.txt>`__
      file for further information.

   That initial, 5.6, basic release included *timer* interrupts and a
   *serial console* and was verified using the NuttX OS test
   (``apps/examples/ostest``). Configurations available include include
   a verified NuttShell (NSH) configuration (see the `NSH User
   Guide <http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html>`__). The
   NSH configuration supports the Nucleus2G's microSD slot and
   additional configurations are available to exercise the USB serial
   and USB mass storage devices. However, due to some technical reasons,
   neither the SPI nor the USB device drivers are fully verified.
   (Although they have since been verified on other platforms; this
   needs to be revisited on the Nucleus2G).

   **Obsoleted**. Support for the Nucleus2G board was terminated on
   2016-04-12. There has not been any activity with the commercial board
   in a few years and it no longer appears to be available from the
   2g-eng.com website. Since the board is commercial and no longer
   publicly available, it no longer qualifies for inclusion in the open
   source repositories. A snapshot of the code is still available in the
   `Obsoleted
   repository <https://bitbucket.org/patacongo/obsoleted/src/master/boards/nucleus2g>`__
   and can easily be *reconstitued* if needed.

#. **mbed LPC1768**

   -  Support for the mbed board was contributed by Dave Marples and
      released in NuttX-5.11. Refer to the NuttX board
      `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/mbed/README.txt>`__
      file for further information.

#. **Olimex LPC1766-STK**

   -  Support for that Olimex-LPC1766-STK board was added to NuttX 5.13.
   -  The NuttX-5.14 release extended that support with an *Ethernet
      driver*.
   -  The NuttX-5.15 release further extended the support with a
      functional *USB device driver* and *SPI-based micro-SD*.
   -  The NuttX-5.16 release added a functional *USB host controller
      driver* and *USB host mass storage class driver*.
   -  The NuttX-5.17 released added support for low-speed USB devices,
      interrupt endpoints, and a *USB host HID keyboard class driver*.
   -  Refer to the NuttX board
      `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt>`__

   Verified configurations are now available for the NuttShell with
   networking and microSD support(NSH, see the `NSH User
   Guide <http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html>`__), for
   the NuttX network test, for the
   `THTTPD <http://acme.com/software/thttpd>`__ webserver, for USB
   serial deive and USB storage devices examples, and for the USB host
   HID keyboard driver. Support for the USB host mass storage device can
   optionally be configured for the NSH example. A driver for the *Nokia

ON Semiconductor LC823450 (Dual core ARM Cortex-M3). In NuttX-7.22,
Masayuki Ishikawa contributed support for both the LC823450 architecture
and for ON Semiconductor's **LC823450XGEVK board**:

   The LC823450XGEVK is an audio processing system Evaluation Board Kit
   used to demonstrate the LC823450. This part can record and playback,
   and offers High-Resolution 32-bit & 192 kHz audio processing
   capability. It is possible to cover most of the functions necessary
   for a portable audio with only this LSI as follows. It has Dual CPU
   and DSP with High processing capability, and internal 1656K-Byte
   SRAM, which make it possible to implement large scale program. And it
   has integrated analog functions (low-power Class D HP amplifier, PLL,
   ADC etc.) so that PCB space and cost is reduced, and it has various
   interface (USB, SD, SPI, UART, etc.) to make extensibility high. Also
   it is provided with various function including SBC/AAC codec by DSP
   and UART and ASRC (Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter) for Bluetooth®
   audio. It is very small chip size in spite of the multi-funciton as
   described above and it realizes the low power consumption. Therefore,
   it is applicable to portable audio markets such as Wireless headsets
   and will show high performance.

Further information about the LC823450XGEVK is available on from the the
`ON
Semiconductor <http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/evalBoard.do?id=LC823450XGEVK>`__

**OmnibusF4**. Initial support for the OmnibusF4 family of flight
management units was contributed by Bill Gatliff in NuttX-7.29.
"OmnibusF4" is not a product name *per se*, but rather a design
specification that many product vendors adhere to. The specification
defines the major components, and how those components are wired into
the microcontroller. *Airbot* is one such vendor. They publish a
`schematic <http://bit.ly/obf4pro>`__. Other software that supports the
OmnibusF4 family include Betaflight, iNAV, and many others. PX4 recently
added support as well, also based on NuttX. No code from those resources
is included in this port. The OmnibusF4 specification mandates the
InvenSense MPU6000 which is included in NuttX-7.29 along with a driver
for the MAX7546 OSD.

NCP LPC43xx. Several board ports are available for this higher end, NXP
Cortex-M4F part:

**NXG Technologies LPC4330-Xplorer**. This NuttX port is for the
LPC4330-Xplorer board from NGX Technologies featuring the NXP
LPC4330FET100 MCU. See the `NXG
website <http://shop.ngxtechnologies.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_37&products_id=104>`__
for further information about this board.

-  **STATUS:** Refer to the NuttX board

   file for more detailed information about this port.

-  **NuttX-6.20** The basic LPC4330-Xplorer port is complete. The basic
   NuttShell (NSH) configuration is present and fully verified. This
   includes verified support for: SYSTICK system time, pin and GPIO
   configuration, and a serial console.

**NXP/Embest LPC4357-EVB**. This NuttX port is for the LPC4357-EVB from
NXP/Embest featuring the NXP LPC4357FET256 MCU. The LPC4357 differs from
the LPC4330 primarily in that it includes 1024KiB of on-chip NOR FLASH.

   file for more detailed information about this port.

-  **NuttX-7.6**. The basic port is was contributed by Toby Duckworth.
   This port leverages from the LPC4330-Xplorer port (and, as of this
   writing, still requires some clean up of the technical discussion in
   some files). The basic NuttShell (NSH) configuration is present and
   has been verified. Support is generally the same as for the
   LPC4330-Xplorer as discussed above.

**NXP LPC4370-Link2**. This is the NuttX port to the NXP LPC4370-Link2
development board featuring the NXP LPC4370FET100 MCU.

-  **STATUS:** Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/lpc43xx/lpc4370-link2/README.txt>`__
   file for more detailed information about this port.

-  **NuttX-7.12** The NXP LPC4370-Link2 port is was contributed by Lok
   Tep and first released in NuttX-7.12.

**WaveShare LPC4337-WS**. This is the NuttX port to the WaveShare
LPC4337-WS development board featuring the NXP LPC4337JBD144 MCU.

-  **STATUS:** Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/lpc43xx/lpc4337-ws/README.txt>`__
   file for more detailed information about this port.

-  **NuttX-7.14** The NXP WaveShare LPC4337-WS port is was contributed
   by Lok Tep and first released in NuttX-7.14.

-  **NuttX-7.16** Support for the LPC4337JET100 chip was contribed by
   Alexander Vasiljev. Alexander also contributed an LPC43xx AES driver
   available in NuttX-7.16.

| 

**Driver Status**.

-  **NuttX-6.20** Several drivers have been copied from the related
   LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx: ADC, DAC,
   GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP. The registers for these blocks are the same
   in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into
   the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin
   configuration logic.

   Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because
   these peripherals have been completely redesigned: CAN, Ethernet, USB
   device, and USB host.

   So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals:
   SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI,
   Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.

   Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support
   the same peripheral IP:

   -  The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG
      peripheral for the LPC31xx. The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver
      has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into
      the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration). It should be
      possible to complete porting of this LPC31xx driver with a small
      porting effort.
   -  The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32
      Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the
      NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.

-  **NuttX-6.21** Added support for a SPIFI block driver and for RS-485
   option to the serial driver.

-  **NuttX-7.17** EMC support was extended to include support SDRAM by
   Vytautas Lukenska.

-  **NuttX-7.23** A CAN driver was contributed by Alexander Vasiljev in
   NuttX-7.23.

-  **NuttX-7.24** RTC and Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) drivers were
   leveraged from the LPC17 and contributed by Gintaras Drukteinis.
   Leveraged the LPC54xx SD/MMC to the LPC43xx. There are still
   remaining issues with the SD/MMC driver and it is not yet functional.

Atmel SAM4L. This port uses the Atmel SAM4L Xplained Pro development
board. This board features the ATSAM4LC4C MCU running at 48MHz with
256KB of FLASH and 32KB of internal SRAM.

**STATUS:** As of this writing, the basic port is code complete and a
fully verified configuration exists for the NuttShell
`NSH <http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html>`__). The first
fully functional SAM4L Xplained Pro port was released in NuttX-6.28.
Support for the SAM4L Xplained modules was added in NuttX-6.29:

-  Support for the SPI-based SD card on the I/O1 module.
-  Driver for the LED1 segment LCD module.
-  Support for the UG-2832HSWEG04 OLED on the SAM4L Xplained Pro's OLED1
   module

Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/sam34/sam4l-xplained/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**Memory Usage**. The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has
256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM. Below is the current memory usage for the
NSH configuration (June 9, 2013). This is *not* a minimal
implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.

Static memory usage can be shown with ``size`` command:

NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH
leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application
development. Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (<7%) and leaves 29.7KB
(92.7%) available for heap at runtime.

SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH ``free`` command. This
runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage *plus* all dynamic
memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:

You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is still available for
further application development while NSH is running.

**Micropendous 3 AT90USB64x** and **AT90USB6128x**. This port of NuttX
to the Opendous Micropendous 3 board. The Micropendous3 is may be
populated with an AT90USB646, 647, 1286, or 1287. I have only the
AT90USB647 version for testing. This version have very limited memory
resources: 64K of FLASH and 4K of SRAM.

**PJRC Teensy++ 2.0 AT90USB1286**. This is a port of NuttX to the PJRC
Teensy++ 2.0 board. This board was developed by
`PJRC <http://pjrc.com/teensy/>`__. The Teensy++ 2.0 is based on an
Atmel AT90USB1286 MCU.

**AVR-Specific Issues**. The basic AVR port is solid. The biggest issue
for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash
is inaccessible using "normal" memory reads and writes (only SRAM data
can be accessed "normally"). Special AVR instructions are available for
accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the
normal, general purpose OS.

Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings
used for ``printf()`` and debug output. These strings are all stored in
SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest
console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory. So, in
order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be
done:

#. Don't use console applications that required lots of strings. The
   basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application
   should work fine. Or,
#. Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings
   that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

**Development Environments:** 1) Linux with native Linux GNU toolchain,
2) Cygwin/MSYS with Cygwin GNU toolchain, 3) Cygwin/MSYS with Windows
native toolchain, or 4) Native Windows. All testing, however, has been
performed using the NuttX DIY toolchain for Linux or Cygwin is provided
by the NuttX
`buildroot <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
package. As a result, that toolchain is recommended.

Atmel AVR32.

| 

AV32DEV1. This port uses the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the
Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU. This port requires a special GNU avr32 toolchain
available from atmel.com website. This is a windows native toolchain and
so can be used only under Cygwin on Windows.

**STATUS:** This port is has completed all basic development, but there
is more that needs to be done. All code is complete for the basic NuttX
port including header files for all AT32UC3\* peripherals. The untested
AVR32 code was present in the 5.12 release of NuttX. Since then, the
basic RTOS port has solidified:

-  The port successfully passes the NuttX OS test
   (apps/examples/ostest).
-  A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the `NSH User
   Guide <http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html>`__).
   Testing of that configuration has been postponed (because it got
   bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port). Current Status: I think I
   have a hardware problem with my serial port setup. There is a good
   chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet
   able to demonstrate that. At present, I get nothing coming in the
   serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I
   have the MAX232 connected wrong).

The basic, port was be released in NuttX-5.13. A complete port will
include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3 devices -- like SPI and USB ---
and will be available in a later release, time permitting. Refer to the
NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/avr/at32uc3/avr32dev1/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**Misoc**.

| 

Misoc LM32 Architectural Support. Architectural support for the Misoc
LM32 was contributed by Ramtin Amin in NuttX 7.19

Minerva. Architectural support for the Misoc Minoerva was contributed by
Ramtin Amin in NuttX 7.29.

**Drivers**. Driver support is basic in these initial releases: Serial,
Timer, and Ethernet. "Board" support is a available for developing with
Misoc LM32 under Qemu or on your custom FPGA.

|image0|

OpenRISC mor1kx.

| 

**OpenRISC mor1kx Architectural Support**. Architectural support for the
OpenRISC mor1kx was developed by Matt Thompson Amin and released in
NuttX 7.25. Currently only an mor1kx Qemu simulation is available for
testing.

|image0|

Freescale M68HCS12.

| 

**MC9S12NE64**. Support for the MC9S12NE64 MCU and two boards are
included:

-  The Freescale DEMO9S12NE64 Evaluation Board, and
-  The Future Electronics Group NE64 /PoE Badge board.

Both use a GNU arm-nuttx-elf toolchain\* under Linux or Cygwin. The
NuttX `buildroot <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
provides a properly patched GCC 3.4.4 toolchain that is highly optimized
for the m9s12x family.

Intel 80x86.

| 

**QEMU/Bifferboard i486**. This port uses the
`QEMU <http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page>`__ i486 and the native Linux,
Cygwin, MinGW the GCC toolchain under Linux or Cygwin.

**STATUS:** The basic port was code-complete in NuttX-5.19 and verified
in NuttX-6.0. The port was verified using the OS and NuttShell (NSH)
examples under QEMU. The port is reported to be functional on the
`Bifferboard <http://bifferos.bizhat.com>`__ as well. In NuttX 7.1,
Lizhuoyi contributed additional keyboard and VGA drivers. This is a
great, stable starting point for anyone interested in fleshing out the
x86 port! Refer to the NuttX
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/x86/qemu/qemu-i486/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**QEMU/Intel64** An x86_64 flat address port was ported in NuttX-9.0. It
consists of the following feautres:

-  - Runs in x86_64 long mode.
-  - Configurable SSE/AVX support.
-  - IRQs are managed by LAPIC(X2APIC) and IOAPIC.
-  - Used TSC_DEADLINE or APIC timer for systick.
-  - Pages are now maps the kernel at 4GB~, but changeable.

This kernel with ostest have been tested with

-  Qemu/KVM on a Xeon 2630v4 machine.
-  Bochs with broadwell_ult emulation.

PIC32MX4xx Family.

**PIC32MX440F512H**. This port uses the "Advanced USB Storage Demo
Board," Model DB-DP11215, from `Sure
Electronics <http://www.sureelectronics.net>`__. This board features the
Microchip PIC32MX440F512H. See the `Sure
website <http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1168>`__ for
further information about the DB-DP11215 board. (I believe that that the
DB-DP11215 may be obsoleted now but replaced with the very similar,
DB-DP11212. The DB-DP11212 board differs, I believe, only in its serial
port configuration.)

**PIC32MX460F512L**. There one two board ports using this chip:

-  **PIC32MX Board from PCB Logic Design Co**. This port is for the
   PIC32MX board from PCB Logic Design Co. and used the PIC32MX460F512L.
   The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the
   PIC32 MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG
   connector.
-  **UBW32 Board from Sparkfun** This is the port to the Sparkfun UBW32
   board. This port uses the `original
   v2.5 <http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8971>`__ board which is based
   on the Microchip PIC32MX460F512L. This older version has been
   replaced with this `newer
   board <http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713>`__. See also the
   `UBW32 <http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW32/>`__ web site.

Microchip PIC32MZ.

| 

PIC32MZEC Family (MIPS microAptiv). A port is in available for the
PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity (EC) Starter Kit. There are two
configurations of the Microchip PIC32MZ EC Starter Kit:

#. The PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity Starter Kit based on the
   PIC32MZ2048ECH144-I/PH chip (DM320006), and
#. The PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity Starter Kit based on the
   PIC32MZ2048ECM144-I/PH w/Crypto Engine (DM320006-C).

See the `Microchip <http://www.microchip.com>`__ website for further
information.

This was a collaborative effort between Kristopher Tate, David Sidrane
and myself. The basic port is functional and a NuttShell (NSH)
configuration is available.

PIC32MZEF Family (MIPS M5150). A port is in available for the
MikroElectronika `Flip&Click
PIC32MZ <https://www.mikroe.com/flipclick-pic32mz>`__ development board
based on the PIC32MZ2048EFH100 MCU. This board configuration was added
in NuttX-7.24 and is, for the most part, compatible with the PIC32MZEC
family.

**STATUS:**

**NuttX-7.9**. The first official release was in NuttX-7.9. Many drivers
port simply from the PIC32MX; others require more extensive efforts.
Driver status as of (2015-03-29) is provided below:

-  I/O ports include I/O port interrupts
-  UART serial driver that provides the NSH console,
-  Timer,
-  I2C (untested),
-  SPI (untested),
-  On-board buttons and LEDs,
-  Ethernet (code complete, but not yet functional),

**NuttX-7.29**. Abdelatif Guettouche contributed additional timer
support including: Timer lower half driver, free-running, and one-shot
timers.

**NuttX-7.31**. Abdelatif Guettouche contributed DMA support.

**NuttX-9.0**. Cache operations were implemented.

Renesas/Hitachi SuperH.

| 

**SH-1 SH7032**. This port uses the Hitachi SH-1 Low-Cost Evaluation
Board (SH1_LCEVB1), US7032EVB, with a GNU ELF toolchain\* under Linux or
Cygwin.

|image0|

Renesas M16C/26.

| 

**Renesas M16C/26 Microcontroller**. This port uses the Renesas SKP16C26
Starter kit and the GNU M32C toolchain. The development environment is
either Linux or Cygwin under WinXP.

**STATUS:** Initial source files released in nuttx-0.4.2. At this point,
the port has not been integrated; the target cannot be built because the
GNU ``m16c-nuttx-elf-ld`` link fails with the following message:

Where the reference line is:

No workaround is known at this time. This is a show stopper for M16C.

Renesas RX65N.

| 

Support for the Renesas RX65N family was released in NuttX with a
contribution from Anjana. Two boards are supported in this initial
release:

-  **RSK RX65N-2MB**.
-  **GR-Rose**.

**STATUS**

-  **NuttX-8.2**
-  **NuttX-9.0** RTC driver for the RX65N was added.

RISC-V.

| 

RISC-V Architectural Support. Basic support for the RISC-V architecture
was contributed by Ken Pettit in NuttX-7.19. This support is for a
custom NEXT RISC-V NR5Mxx (RV32IM). The initial release is *thin* but a
great starting point for anyone interested in RISC-V development with
NuttX.

GreenWaves GAP8 (RV32IM). Basic support GreenWaves GAP8 *gapuino* board
was added by hhuysqt in NuttX-7.27. The GAP8 is a 1+8-core DSP-like
RISC-V MCU. The GAP8 features a RI5CY core called Fabric Controller(FC),
and a cluster of 8 RI5CY cores that runs at a bit slower speed. The GAP8
is an implementation of the opensource PULP platform, a
Parallel-Ultra-Low-Power design.

`Sipeed Maix bit <#k210>`__

Initial support for the Sipeed Maix bit board was added in Nuttx-9.0.

Litex ARTY_A7. Support for the Digilent ARTY_A7 board along with CPU
VexRiscV SOC were added in NuttX-9.0.

|image0|

ESP32 (Dual Xtensa LX6).

| 

**Xtensa LX6 ESP32 Architectural Support**. Basic architectural support
for Xtensa LX6 processors and the port for the Espressif ESP32 were
added in NuttX-7.19. The basic ESP32 port is function in both single CPU
and dual CPU SMP configurations.

**Espressif ESP32 Core v2 Board** The NuttX release includes support for
Espressif ESP32 Core v2 board. There is an NSH configuration for each
CPU configuration and an OS test configuration for verificatin of the
port.

**STATUS**. ESP32 support in NuttX-7.19 is functional, but very
preliminary. There is little yet in the way of device driver support.
Outstanding issues include missing clock configuration logic, missing
partition tables to support correct configuration from FLASH, and some
serial driver pin configuration issues. The configuration is usable
despite these limitations. Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/xtensa/esp32/esp32-core/README.txt>`__

-  **Zilog z16f2800100zcog development kit**. This port use the Zilog
   z16f2800100zcog development kit and the Zilog ZDS-II Windows command
   line tools. The development environment is either Windows native or
   Cygwin under Windows.

   **STATUS:** The initial release of support for the z16f was made
   available in NuttX version 0.3.7. A working NuttShell (NSH)
   configuration as added in NuttX-6.33 (although a patch is required to
   work around an issue with a ZDS-II 5.0.1 tool problem). An ESPI
   driver was added in NuttX-7.2. Refer to the NuttX board
   `README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/z16/z16f/z16f2800100zcog/README.txt>`__

Zilog eZ80 Acclaim!.

| 

**Zilog eZ80Acclaim! Microcontroller**. There are four eZ80Acclaim!
ports:

-  The ZiLOG ez80f0910200kitg development kit.
-  The ZiLOG ez80f0910200zcog-d development kit.
-  The MakerLisp CPU board.
-  The Z20x DIY computing system.

All three boards are based on the eZ80F091 part and all use the Zilog
ZDS-II Windows command line tools. The development environment is either
Windows native or Cygwin or MSYS2 under Windows.

|image0|

Zilog Z8Encore!.

| 

**Zilog Z8Encore! Microcontroller**. This port uses the either:

-  Zilog z8encore000zco development kit, Z8F6403 part, or
-  Zilog z8f64200100kit development kit, Z8F6423 part

and the Zilog ZDS-II Windows command line tools. The development
environment is either Windows native or Cygwin under Windows.

**STATUS:** This release has been verified only on the ZiLOG ZDS-II
Z8Encore! chip simulation as of nuttx-0.3.9. Refer to the NuttX board
README files for the
`z8encore000zco <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/ez80/z8/z8encore000zco/README.txt>`__
and for
the\ `z8f64200100kit <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/ez80/z8/z8f64200100kit/README.txt>`__

Zilog Z180.

| 

**P112**. The P112 is a hobbyist single board computer based on a 16MHz
Z80182 with up to 1MB of memory, serial, parallel and diskette IO, and
realtime clock, in a 3.5-inch drive form factor. The P112 computer
originated as a commercial product of "D-X Designs Pty Ltd"[ of
Australia.

Dave Brooks was successfully funded through Kickstarter for and another
run of P112 boards in November of 2012. In addition Terry Gulczynski
makes additional P112 derivative hobbyist home brew computers.

**STATUS:** Most of the NuttX is in port for both the Z80182 and for the
P112 board. Boards from Kickstarter project will not be available,
however, until the third quarter of 2013. So it will be some time before
this port is verified on hardware. Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/z80/z180/p112/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

Zilog Z80.

| 

**Z80 Instruction Set Simulator**. This port uses the
`SDCC <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>`__ toolchain under Linux or Cygwin
(verified using version 2.6.0). This port has been verified using only a
Z80 instruction simulator called z80sim.

**STATUS:** This port is complete and stable to the extent that it can
be tested using an instruction set simulator. Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/z80/z80/z80sim/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

| 

--------------

| 

**XTRS: TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator for Unix**. A very similar Z80
port is available for `XTRS <http://www.tim-mann.org/xtrs.html>`__, the
TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator for Unix. That port also uses the
`SDCC <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>`__ toolchain under Linux or Cygwin
(verified using version 2.6.0).

**STATUS:** Basically the same as for the Z80 instruction set simulator.
This port was contributed by Jacques Pelletier. Refer to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/patacongo/obsoleted/src/master/configs/xtrs/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**NOTE:** This port was removed from the NuttX source tree on
2017-11-24. It was removed because (1) it is unfinished, unverified, and
unsupported, and (2) the TRS-80 simulation is a sub-optimal platform.i
That platform includes a 16-bit ROM image and only a 48Kb RAM space for
NuttX. The removed board support is still available in the ``Obsoleted``
repository if anyone would ever like to resurrect it.

   \* A highly modified `buildroot <http://buildroot.uclibc.org/>`__ is
   available that may be used to build a NuttX-compatible ELF toolchain
   under Linux or Cygwin. Configurations are available in that buildroot
   to support ARM, Cortex-M3, avr, m68k, m68hc11, m68hc12, m9s12,
   blackfin, m32c, h8, and SuperH ports.

.. _development-environments:

Development Environments
------------------------

|image0|

**Linux + GNU ``make`` + GCC/binutils for Linux**

|

The is the most natural development environment for NuttX. Any version
of the GCC/binutils toolchain may be used. There is a highly modified
`buildroot <http://buildroot.uclibc.org/>`__ available for download from
the `NuttX
Bitbucket.org <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
page. This download may be used to build a NuttX-compatible ELF
toolchain under Linux or Cygwin. That toolchain will support ARM, m68k,
m68hc11, m68hc12, and SuperH ports. The buildroot GIT may be accessed in
the NuttX `buildroot GIT <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot>`__.

|image0|

**Linux + GNU ``make`` + SDCC for Linux**

|

Also very usable is the Linux environment using the
`SDCC <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/>`__ compiler. The SDCC compiler
provides support for the 8051/2, z80, hc08, and other microcontrollers.
The SDCC-based logic is less well exercised and you will likely find
some compilation issues if you use parts of NuttX with SDCC that have
not been well-tested.

|image0|

**Windows with Cygwin + GNU ``make`` + GCC/binutils (custom built under
Cygwin)**

|

This combination works well too. It works just as well as the native
Linux environment except that compilation and build times are a little
longer. The custom NuttX
`buildroot <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
referenced above may be build in the Cygwin environment as well.

|image0|

**Windows with Cygwin + GNU ``make`` + SDCC (custom built under
Cygwin)**

|

I have never tried this combination, but it would probably work just
fine.

|image0|

**Windows with Cygwin + GNU ``make`` + Windows Native Toolchain**

|

This is a tougher environment. In this case, the Windows native
toolchain is unaware of the Cygwin *sandbox* and, instead, operates in
the native Windows environment. The primary difficulties with this are:

-  **Paths**. Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows
   standards. For example, the path ``/home/my\ name/nuttx/include`` my
   have to be converted to something like
   ``'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'`` to be usable by the
   toolchain.
-  **Symbolic Links** NuttX depends on symbolic links to install
   platform-specific directories in the build system. On Linux, true
   symbolic links are used. On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
   Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside
   of the Cygwin *sandbox*, these symbolic links cannot be used.
-  **Dependencies** NuttX uses the GCC compiler's ``-M`` option to
   generate make dependencies. These dependencies are retained in files
   called ``Make.deps`` throughout the system. For compilers other than
   GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.

**Supported Windows Native Toolchains**. At present, the following
Windows native toolchains are in use:

#. GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM,
   etc.),
#. SDCC built for Windows,
#. the ZiLOG XDS-II toolchain for Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim parts.

|image0|

**Windows Native (``CMD.exe``) + GNUWin32 (including GNU ``make``) +
MinGW Host GCC compiler + Windows Native Toolchain**

|

Build support has been added to support building natively in a Windows
console rather than in a POSIX-like environment.

This build:

#. Uses all Windows style paths
#. Uses primarily Windows batch commands from cmd.exe, with
#. A few extensions from GNUWin32

This capability first appeared in NuttX-6.24 and should still be
considered a work in progress because: (1) it has not been verfied on
all targets and tools, and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts
of the more mature environments. The windows native build logic
initiated if ``CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y`` is defined in the NuttX
configuration file:

At present, this build environment also requires:

**Windows Console**. The build must be performed in a Windows console
window. This may be using the standard ``CMD.exe`` terminal that comes
with Windows. I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/

**GNUWin32**. The build still relies on some Unix-like commands. I
usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/. See the top-level ``nuttx/README.txt``
file for some download, build, and installation notes.

**MinGW-GCC**. MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the
``nuttx/tools`` directory that are needed by the build. MinGW-GCC can be
downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/. If you are using GNUWin32, then
it is recommended that you not install the optional MSYS components as
there may be conflicts.

|image0|

**Wine + GNU ``make`` + Windows Native Toolchain**

|

I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80
user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:

   "I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine
   (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were
   needed to make GIT snapshot of NuttX buildable... I've tried nsh
   profile and build process completed successfully. One remark is
   necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing ``cygpath``
   utility. Wine provides similar thing called ``winepath`` which is
   compatible and offers compatible syntax. To use that, ``winepath``
   (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as ``cygpath``
   somewhere in ``$PATH``, and edited as in following patch:

   "Better solution would be replacing all ``cygpath`` references in
   ``Makefiles`` with ``$(CONVPATH)`` (or ``${CONVPATH}`` in shell
   scripts) and setting ``CONVPATH`` to ``cygpath`` or ``winepath``
   regarding to currently used environment.

|image0|

**Other Environments?**

|

**Environment Dependencies**. The primary environmental dependency of
NuttX are (1) GNU make, (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities
(such as cat, sed, etc.). If you have other platforms that support GNU
make or make utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is
very likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
modification of the Make system would be required.

**MSYS**. I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX
users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the
above Cygwin environments. This is not surprising since MSYS is based on
an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3). MSYS has been modified,
however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin
and that may be of value to some users.

MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build
because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the ``CMD.exe``
shell. Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build environment.
